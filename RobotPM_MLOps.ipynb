    "# 🚀 Robot Predictive Maintenance: MLOps Architecture Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the evolution of the Linear Regression project into a professional MLOps-ready framework. Below is a summary of the key additions and enhancements implemented to meet the workshop requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ 1. Recommended Additions (Architectural Updates)\n",
    "To improve maintainability and scalability, the following folder structures and files were integrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`configs/` Folder**: Implemented **Config-Driven Development**. All hyperparameters (Learning Rate, Iterations) and maintenance thresholds are now managed via `experiment_config.yaml`, eliminating hardcoded values in the code.\n",
    "* **`experiments/` Folder**: Added `results.csv` for **Experiment Tracking**. This allows for the historical recording of model performance metrics (RMSE) and RUL predictions across different versions.\n",
    "* **`models/` Folder**: Implemented **Model Persistence**. Successfully integrated a serialization step using `pickle` to save the trained linear regression weights (`.pkl`), ensuring the model can be deployed without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ 2. Recommended Enhancements (Functional Improvements)\n",
    "The core logic has been upgraded to handle real-world industrial data complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hybrid Data Ingestion**: The `load_from_db` function was added to support **PostgreSQL (Neon)** connectivity, providing a scalable alternative to local CSV files.\n",
    "* **Advanced Preprocessing**: Integrated **Moving Average Smoothing** in `preprocessing.py`. This was crucial for filtering high-frequency sensor noise from Robot Axis #1, which previously hindered model accuracy.\n",
    "* **Data Splitting (60/40)**: Implemented a strict temporal split (60% training, 40% evaluation) to validate the model's **Generalization Ability** on unseen future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 3. Breakdown Example: RUL & Alerting Case Study\n",
    "The following implementation represents the final deliverable of the predictive maintenance logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RUL Calculation**: The system now translates mathematical slopes into a physical **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** metric.\n",
    "* **Optimal Smoothing**: Through a Hyperparameter Sweep, **Window Size: 500** was identified as the optimal setting, reducing **Test RMSE to 0.7027**.\n",
    "* **Early Warning System**: \n",
    "    * **Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL ALERT**\n",
    "    * **Predicted RUL**: 0.6 Days\n",
    "    * **Logic**: The system successfully triggered an automated alert as the RUL fell below the 14-day safety buffer defined in the config.\n",
